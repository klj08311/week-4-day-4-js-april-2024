    <h1>Objects</h1> 

    <p>
      With our 8 types in JavaScript we can represent data such as Numbers,
      Strings, and Booleans.
    </p>

    <p>What if we want to represent several at once?</p>

    <h3>Example Object</h3>

    <p>A person might have a name</p>

    <pre>
  let firstName = "edward";
</pre
    >

    <p>A person might have a favorite ice cream flavor</p>

    <pre>
  let iceCream = "pistachio";
</pre
    >

    <p>JavaScript lets us put this together in an OBJECT with this syntax...</p>

    <pre>
  // declare and assign
  let person = {
    name: "edward",
    iceCream: "pistachio"
  }; 

  // access properties of the object
  document.write(person.name);
  document.write(person.iceCream);

</pre
    >

    <script>
      let person = {
        name: "edward",
        iceCream: "pistachio",
      };

      document.write("<br>");
      document.write(`${person.name} likes ${person.iceCream}`);
      document.write("<br>");
    </script>

    <h3>Practice</h3>

    />

    <p>TODO: Try assigning objects to variables.</p>

    <script>
      person1 = {
        name: "andy",
        iceCream: "choco",
      };

      person2 = {
        name: "betty",
        iceCream: "pistachio",
      };
      // TODO: create objects and assign them below.
      person3 = {
        name: "cal",
        icecream: "vanilla",
      };
      person4 = {
        name: "drewelle",
        icecream: "strawberry",
      };
      person5 = {
        name: "elsie",
        icecream: "peach",
      };

      document.write(`${person1.name} likes ${person1.iceCream} <br>`);
      document.write(`${person2.name} likes ${person2.iceCream} <br>`);
      document.write(`${person3.name} likes ${person3.iceCream} <br>`);
      document.write(`${person4.name} likes ${person4.iceCream} <br>`);
      document.write(`${person5.name} likes ${person5.iceCream} <br>`);
    </script>

    <h3>More properties</h3>

    <p>
      We can make objects with as many properties as we like. Let's try three.
    </p>

    <pre>
  // re-assign person with 
  person = {
    name: "edward",
    iceCream: "pistachio",
    shirt: "green"
  };
</pre
    >
    <script>
      person1 = {
        name: "andy",
        iceCream: "choco",
        shirt: "blue",
      };

      person2 = {
        name: "betty",
        iceCream: "pistachio",
        shirt: "lavender",
      };
      // TODO: create objects and assign them below.
      person3 = {
        name: "cal",
        icecream: "vanilla",
      };
      person4 = {
        name: "drewelle",
        icecream: "strawberry",
      };
      person5 = {
        name: "elsie",
        icecream: "peach",
      };
    </script>

    <p>
      TODO: Practice re-assigning all the people with a new object including
      shirt color.
    </p>

    <script>
      person1 = {
        name: "andy",
        iceCream: "choco",
        shirt: "blue",
        candy: "nerds",
      };

      // TODO: re-assign these variables
      person2 = {
        name: "betty",
        iceCream: "pistachio",
        shirt: "lavender",
        candy: "gummy bears",
      };
      person3 = {
        name: "cal",
        iceCream: "vanilla",
        shirt: "green",
        candy: "butterscotch",
      };
      person4 = {
        name: "drewelle",
        iceCream: "strawberry",
        shirt: "pink",
        candy: "gumdrops",
      };
      person5 = {
        name: "elsie",
        iceCream: "peach",
        shirt: "yellow",
        candy: "peppermint",
      };

      // TODO: write them all out
      document.write(
        `${person1.name} likes ${person1.iceCream} and ${person1.candy} and is wearing a ${person1.shirt} shirt <br>`
      );
      document.write(
        `${person2.name} likes ${person2.iceCream} and ${person2.candy} and is wearing a ${person2.shirt} shirt <br>`
      );
      document.write(
        `${person3.name} likes ${person3.iceCream} and ${person3.candy} and is wearing a ${person3.shirt} shirt <br>`
      );
      document.write(
        `${person4.name} likes ${person4.iceCream} and ${person4.candy} and is wearing a ${person4.shirt} shirt <br>`
      );
      document.write(
        `${person5.name} likes ${person5.iceCream} and ${person5.candy} and is wearing a ${person5.shirt} shirt <br>`
      );
    </script>

    <h3>Try it out!</h3>

    <p>
      Now, try to think of another object you can represent in computer code. It
      could be a cookie, a dog, an order, anything!
    </p>

    <script>
      // TODO: make at least 5 objects and assign them to variables

      // TODO: write them out all to the document
    </script>

    <h2>Bonus: Objects and Arrays</h2>

    <p>Arrays can contain any type: Strings, Booleans, Numbers...</p>

    <p>Arrays can contain objects, too!</p>

    <p>
      The syntax is confusing at first, but look carefully, and you'll see it.
    </p>

    <pre>
  let catArray = [
    {
      name: "fluffy",
      breed: "persian"
    },
    {
      name: "eclipse",
      breed: "siamese"
    },
    {
      name: "luna",
      breed: "himalayan"
    }
  ]
</pre
    >

    <h3>Challenge:</h3>
    <p>
      Try to create an array of your own objects. Then access them by index in
      the array. Then access the properties. Share with a partner if you get
      stuck.
    </p>

    <script>
      // TODO: make an array of some object
      let arrayOfSomething = [{}, {}, {}];

      // TODO: print them out to the document.
      // Think about combining what you know about arrays and objects. Ask for help if stuck!
    </script>
